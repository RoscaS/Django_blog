# Quick tips

Why use `reverse_lazy` instead of `reverse`? The reason is that for all generic class-based views the urls are not loaded when the file is imported, so we have to use the lazy form of reverse to load them later when theyâ€™re available.

----------

The UserCreationForm does not provide an email field. But we can extend it.
Create a file named forms.py inside the accounts folder:

```py
# accounts/forms.py
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class SignUpForm(UserCreationForm):
    email = forms.CharField(max_length=254, required=True, widget=forms.EmailInput())
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('username', 'email', 'password1', 'password2')
```

```py
# accounts/view.py
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import CreateView
from .forms import SignUpForm

class SignUp(CreateView):
    form_class = SignUpForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name='accounts/signup.html'
```

>>> Post.objects.all()[0].title
'First post'

>>> User.objects.get(username='RoscaS').posts.all()[0].title
'First post'

```
