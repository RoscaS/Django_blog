# Quick tips

Why use `reverse_lazy` instead of `reverse`? The reason is that for all generic class-based views the urls are not loaded when the file is imported, so we have to use the lazy form of reverse to load them later when theyâ€™re available.

----------

The UserCreationForm does not provide an email field. But we can extend it.
Create a file named forms.py inside the accounts folder:

```py
# accounts/forms.py
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class SignUpForm(UserCreationForm):
    email = forms.CharField(max_length=254, required=True, widget=forms.EmailInput())
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('username', 'email', 'password1', 'password2')
```

```py
# accounts/view.py
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import CreateView
from .forms import SignUpForm

class SignUp(CreateView):
    form_class = SignUpForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name='accounts/signup.html'
```

# Mixins through Detail and ListView

* [django official](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/class-based-views/mixins/)

## `DetailView`: working with a single Django obj

To show the detail of an object we need to do 2 things:

1. Lookup the object
2. Make a `TemplateResponse` with a suitable template and that the looked up object as **context**

`DetailView` relies on `SingleObjectMixin` which provides a `get_object()` method that figures out the object based on the URL of the request looking for **pk** or **slug** keyword arguments as declared in the URLConf (settings.py: `ROOT_URLCONF = 'myproject.urls'`) of the request and looks the object up either from `model` attribute on the **view** or the `queryset` attribute if that's provided.

`SingleObjectMixin` alors overrides `get_context_data()`, which is used across all Django's built in CBVs to supply **context data** for templates renders.

# 0.1

## Needs

1. Posts
2. Comments
3. Users

Breaking those 3 things into the following:

1. Models(Database tables)
2. Views(actions on the models themselves - retrieve all, edit, create)
3. Templates(index templates, edit templates, create templates)

### 1 Models(Database tables)

1. Post
2. Comment
3. User

* A User can own 0 to MANY Posts
* A Post can have 0 to MANY Comments
* A User can have 0 to Many Comments

```
Post[
    title,
    body,
    views,
    date,
    user--->User
]

Comment[
    body,
    date,
    user--->User
    post--->Post   
]

User[
    email,
    username,
    password,
    first name
    last name
]
```


### 2 Views (actions)

* As a user of the system, you can **GET ALL** of the Posts
* As a user of the system, you can **CREATE** a Post
* As a user of the system, you can **EDIT** a Post
* As a user of the system, you can **DELETE** a Post
* As a user of the system, you can **GET ALL** of the Comments for a single Post
<br>
* As a user of the system, you can **CREATE** a Comment
* As a user of the system, you can **EDIT** a Comment
* As a user of the system, you can **DELETE** a Comment
<br>
* As a new person, you can **GET ALL** of the Posts
* As a new person, you can **SIGN UP** as a User
* As a new user, you can **LOGIN**
* As a new logged in User you can **LOGOUT**
* As a new logged in User you can **DELETE** your account
<br>
* ...

### 3 Templates

* Home (**GET ALL** of the Posts)
    * **LOGIN**
    * **SIGN UP**
    * **LOGOUT**
    * Profile
        * **DELETE** your account
    

# Urls provided by `auth`

```
accounts/login/ [name='login']
accounts/logout/ [name='logout']
accounts/password_change/ [name='password_change']
accounts/password_change/done/ [name='password_change_done']
accounts/password_reset/ [name='password_reset']

# Role-permissions

* [django-role-permissions](http://django-role-permissions.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)


* Create a roles.py file in the same folder as your settings.py and two roles:
```py
from rolepermissions.roles import AbstractUserRole

class Doctor(AbstractUserRole):
    available_permissions = {
        'create_medical_record': True,
    }

class Nurse(AbstractUserRole):
    available_permissions = {
        'edit_patient_file': True,
    }
```

Add a reference to your roles module to your settings:

```py
ROLEPERMISSIONS_MODULE = 'myapplication.roles'
```

When you create a new user, set its role using:

```py
>>> from rolepermissions.roles import assign_role
>>> user = User.objects.get(id=1)
>>> assign_role(user, 'doctor')
```

and check its permissions using:

```py
>>> from rolepermissions.checkers import has_permission
>>>
>>> has_permission(user, 'create_medical_record')
True
>>> has_permission(user, 'edit_patient_file')
False
```

You can also change users permissions:

```py
>>> from rolepermissions.permissions import grant_permission, revoke_permission
>>>
>>> revoke_permission(user, 'create_medical_record')
>>> grant_permission(user, 'edit_patient_file')
>>>
>>> has_permission(user, 'create_medical_record')
False
>>> has_permission(user, 'edit_patient_file')
True
```
